# Representation, inference and reasoning in AI

### Course Description

An introduction to representations and algorithms for artificial intelligence.  Topics covered include: constraint satisfaction in discrete and continuous problems, logical representation and inference, Monte Carlo tree search, probabilistic graphical models and inference, planning in discrete and continuous deterministic and probabilistic models including MDPs and POMDPs. 

### Syllabus Overview

Here is a non-exhaustive and provisional set of topics that we plan to cover.

**Unit 1: Reasoning with certainty**
* Propositional logic
* Constraint satisfaction problems
* First-order logic
* SAT solvers

**Unit 2: Reasoning with uncertainty**
* Bayesian networks
* Markov random fields, factor graphs
* Sum-product (belief propagation)
* MCMC, sampling-based inference

**Unit 3: Planning with certainty**
* Heuristic search (A\*, GBFS)
* Continuous planning (RRT, PRM)
* PDDL planning
* Delete-relaxation heuristics

**Unit 4: Planning with transition uncertainty**
* Markov decision processes (MDPs)
* Value iteration, policy iteration
* Online and heuristic planning (LAO\*, RTDP)
* Connections to reinforcement learning

**Unit 5: Planning with observation uncertainty**
* Nondeterministic planning (AO search)
* Partially observed MDPs (POMDPs)
* Sampling-based planners (POMCP, DESPOT)
* Determinization

### Role in EECS curriculum

* Pilot version of subject designed for proposed AI+D major
* Can *substitute* for 6.034 as a header in 6-2 and 6-3 (requires petition but guaranteed to be accepted)
* Counts as an EECS subject for 6-1, 6-2, and 6-3, even if you have already taken 6.034
* Counts as a CS12 subject for 6-2 students
* Meets with 16.420 (G), which counts as EECS AUS or AAGS in the AI concentration
* The *combination of this subject and 6.036* will cover almost all of the topics in 6.034 in more technical depth

### Role in AeroAstro curriculum

* 16.420 can be used to satisfy part of the graduate field evaluation in the Autonomy course of study.
* Petitions for 16.420 to be considered as a PAS for the undergraduate degree will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 

### Meeting Time

Monday/Wednesday 9:30 - 11am EST.

### Prerequisites
One from each group:
* 6.006 or 16.410 or 6.034
* 6.042 or 6.041 or 6.008 or 18.05 or 18.600 or 16.09
* 6.009 or other programming subject at similar level (beyond 6.0001/6.0002)
