# Representation, inference and reasoning in AI

### Course Description

An introduction to representations and algorithms for artificial intelligence.  Topics covered include: constraint satisfaction in discrete and continuous problems, logical representation and inference, Monte Carlo tree search, probabilistic graphical models and inference, planning in discrete and continuous deterministic and probabilistic models including MDPs and POMDPs, basic decentralized and game-theoretic models. 

### Role in EECS curriculum

* Pilot version of subject designed for proposed AI+D major
* Can *substitute* for 6.034 as a header in 6-2 and 6-3 (requires petition but guaranteed to be accepted)
* Counts as an EECS subject for 6-1, 6-2, and 6-3, even if you have already taken 6.034
* Counts as a CS12 subject for 6-2 students
* Meets with 16.420 (G), which counts as EECS AUS or AAGS in the AI concentration
* The *combination of this subject and 6.036* will cover almost all of the topics in 6.034 in more technical depth

### Meeting Time

Monday/Wednesday 9:30 - 11am EST.

### Prerequisites
One from each group:
* 6.006 or 16.410 or 6.034
* 6.042 or 6.041 or 6.008 or 18.05 or 18.600 or 16.09
* 6.009 or other programming subject at similar level (beyond 6.0001/6.0002)
